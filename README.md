## Overview

In industries like real estate, access to niche and consistent datasets over time is a challenging endeavor. Often, the data is monopolized by singular entities, such as the government, making access not only limited but arduous. The digital landscape presents a similar challenge, where consumers find themselves devoid of genuine ownership of their data. DataSea aims to reshape this narrative by providing a platform for encrypted dataset streaming and AI model sharing, ensuring both transparency and security.

## Features

- **Encrypted Data Streaming**: DataSea allows providers to stream waves of encrypted datasets and AI models to buyers, ensuring security and authenticity.
- **Consumer Data Ownership**: Empowering users with the ability to securely sell their data, fostering a new age of data sovereignty.
- **Dynamic NFTs**: Utilization of Ocean Protocol to create dynamic NFTs that store encrypted user data, combining data innovation with blockchain integrity.
- **ERC20 Access Tokens**: Facilitating the secure access and transfer of data ownership.
- **ERC 725 Data Storage**: Leveraging Ocean's key-value pairing, DataSea provides a robust data storage mechanism, ensuring consistency and reliability.
- **Reselling Mechanism**: Owners can monetize their data by reselling the ownership and tokenized data through the dispensary.
- **Automated AI Integration**: Streamlining property data to seamlessly integrate into AI or predictive models, paving the way for cutting-edge analytics.

## Technical Stack

- **Ocean Protocol**: Interaction with smart contracts for NFT and token creation.
- **Barge Aquarius & Provider**: Responsible for storing and encrypting data tied to NFTs.
- **FRE & Dispenser**: Tools for NFT creation, updating, and dispensary functionalities.

## How to Use

1. **Data Upload**: Users can upload their datasets, which are then encrypted and tied to a unique NFT.
2. **Access Control**: Utilizing ERC20 access tokens, users can grant or restrict access to their data.
3. **Data Resell**: Using the integrated dispensary, users can monetize their datasets by reselling ownership and tokenized data.
4. **AI Integration**: Automated tools enable the seamless incorporation of property data into predictive models or AI systems.
